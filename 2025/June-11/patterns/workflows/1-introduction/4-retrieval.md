The script is now running successfully! This example demonstrates:

Knowledge Base Retrieval:
Defines a search_kb function to load knowledge base data
Uses GPT-4 to answer questions from the knowledge base
Shows how to structure responses with source information
Tool Selection:
Demonstrates that the model won't use tools for unrelated questions
Shows how the model handles questions outside its knowledge base
The output shows:

A successful response about the return policy (from the knowledge base)
A graceful fallback message for the weather question (since it's not in the knowledge base)
This pattern is particularly useful for building AI assistants that need to:

Maintain consistent information from a knowledge base
Handle out-of-scope questions gracefully
Track the source of information for each response
